## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Capitol Farms feeds 19 horses twice daily. The decisions regarding feed all come from the Barn Manager. Any changes must be disseminated to a team of feeders. The hand written paper feeding schedules are not ideal and prone to mistakes. The Feeding Manager web application will allow the Barn Manager to quickly and easily make changes to the feed schedule and notify all feeders at once. Feeders will be able to run daily reports showing what feed is needed for each horse so that feeding time can occur quickly and efficiently. Medications and supplements can be added on an ongoing basis or for only a short period of time. 


### Features
-AM/PM Feed Reports - Feeders have the ability to run a report for either the AM or PM feed and recieve a display showing feed details for each horse.

-Horse Profiles - Barn Manager and any administrators will have access to edit each horse's profile adjusting their feed requirements for AM and PM feed times.

-Grain Reports - Feeders can run the AM/PM Feed Report by grain type to see which horses get a certain amount of each type of grain.

-Supplements and Medications - Supplements are additives that can be added to a horse's feed. Some supplements should always be added while others are only used for a short amount of time. Medications are similar. These can both be added to a horse's feed schedule for a set period of time or a set number of times.

-User Profiles - Feeders will all have their own login and can mark off each feeding once it has been finished. The Barn Manager will then be able to view which feeder completed which day's feeding.


### Technologies
- C#  
- Bootstrap 
- ASP.net MVC core
- OAuth (Facebook login capability)


### What I'll Have to Learn
I will learn the coding language C# and ASP.net MVC core to complete this project. I will also learn to create a better user interface for a web application using Bootstrap. I'll need to research and find out how to use Facebook to login to the application.
